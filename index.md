**TA Response**

The error seems to indicate that the problem is within the code itself, and not with the command ran. Have you tried searching up the division by zero operation in java?

**Bug Solution**

I was able to find the error! The bug lies in the division operation. When two numbers are equal the denominator becomes zero, which causes a division by zero error. The Arithmetic Exception thrown in the output was something I didn't know, but now I know that it was thrown due to the division by zero error.
